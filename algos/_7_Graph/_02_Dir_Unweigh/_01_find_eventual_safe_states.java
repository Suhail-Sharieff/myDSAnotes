//prereq: detect cycle in an undirected graph

/*
There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

NOTE: there should be no cycles in graph [ALWAYS KEEP THIS IN MIND,though there can be some nodes that lead to terminal, but they can also lead to themselves, ie they have cycle, dont add such nodes]-------VVIMP

Example 1:

Illustration of graph
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.
Example 2:

Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.
 

Constraints:

n == graph.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= graph[i].length <= n
0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1
graph[i] is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
The graph may contain self-loops.
The number of edges in the graph will be in the range [1, 4 * 104].
