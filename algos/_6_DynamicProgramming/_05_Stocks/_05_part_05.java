    /*
     * Stock Buy and Sell â€“ with Cooldown
     * Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 47.04%Submissions: 7K+Points: 4
     * You are given the prices of stock for n number of days. every ith day tell
     * the price of the stock on that day. find the maximum profit that you can make
     * by buying and selling stock with the restriction of After you sell your
     * stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).
     * 
     * Example:
     * Input:
     * 5
     * 1 2 3 0 2
     * Output:
     * 3
     * Explanation:
     * You buy on 1st day and sell on the second day then cooldown, then buy on the
     * fourth day and
     * sell on the fifth day and earn a profit of 3.
     * Your Task:
     * You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the
     * function maximumProfit() which takes the integer n and array prices and
     * returns the maximum profit that can earn.
     * 
     * Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
     * Expected Space Complexity: O(n)
     * 
     * Constraint:
     * 1<=n<=105
     * 1<=prices[i]<=105
     *

    // ans: whenver u sell, do i+2, rather than i+1 as previous problems, meaning
    // that move 2 steps ahead rather than 1 step coz given that after we sold
    // today, we cant buy tomorrow, and also replace == by >= in base case, coz i+2
    // we r doing and it can exceed prices.length
