## Cool Ideas for CP Problems of Type Requiring Observation of Numbers from 1 to n

### Problem 1: Can You Choose K Distinct Numbers Whose Sum is X?

**Given** three positive integers: `n`, `k`, and `x`. Can you choose any `k` distinct numbers between `[1, n]` such that their sum equals `x`?

#### Solution:

To solve this problem, observe the following:

- The **maximum sum** we can get is by choosing the last `k` elements from the range `[1, n]`.
- The **minimum sum** is the sum of the first `k` elements in `[1, n]`.

Thus, we can make the decision based on whether the target `x` lies between these two sums:
- If `x` lies between the **minimum sum** and the **maximum sum**, the answer is always "Yes".
- Otherwise, the answer is "No".

**Key insight**: The answer is "Yes" if and only if the target sum `x` lies in the range `[minSum, maxSum]`.

### Example:

- Let `n = 10`, `k = 3`, and `x = 18`.
  - The maximum sum is obtained by choosing the last 3 elements: `8 + 9 + 10 = 27`.
  - The minimum sum is obtained by choosing the first 3 elements: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
  - Since `18` lies between `6` and `27`, the answer is "Yes".



This problem is an example of how understanding the constraints and the properties of numbers in the range `[1, n]` can help reduce the complexity of the problem by eliminating the need to check all combinations directly.

## Problem 2:You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2]. Each integer appears exactly once except a which appears twice and b which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b.

Return a 0-indexed integer array ans of size 2 where ans[0] equals to a and ans[1] equals to b.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,2]]
Output: [2,4]
Explanation: Number 2 is repeated and number 4 is missing so the answer is [2,4].
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[9,1,7],[8,9,2],[3,4,6]]
Output: [9,5]
Explanation: Number 9 is repeated and number 5 is missing so the answer is [9,5].
 

Constraints:

2 <= n == grid.length == grid[i].length <= 50
1 <= grid[i][j] <= n * n
For all x that 1 <= x <= n * n there is exactly one x that is not equal to any of the grid members.
For all x that 1 <= x <= n * n there is exactly one x that is equal to exactly two of the grid members.
For all x that 1 <= x <= n * n except two of them there is exatly one pair of i, j that 0 <= i, j <= n - 1 and grid[i][j] == x.

 Math
Intuition
At first glance, this problem might seem to require tracking frequencies, but there's a more elegant mathematical approach. In a perfect sequence from 1 to n 
2
 , every number appears exactly once. However, in our given sequence, one number appears twice, and another number is missing. Let’s define the repeated number as x and the missing number as y.

Instead of explicitly counting occurrences, we can leverage basic mathematical properties of numbers. The sum of all numbers in a proper sequence from 1 to n 
2
  can be computed using the formula:

perfectSum= $(n^2*(n^2+1))/2$ 
​
 
Similarly, the sum of the squares of these numbers follows this formula:

perfectSqrSum= $(n^2 *(n^2+1)*(2n^2+1))/2$
​
 
​
 
Now, if we compute the sum of numbers in our given grid (sum) and compare it with perfectSum, we can express their relationship as:

sum=perfectSum+x−y
​
 
This tells us that the difference between the actual sum and the perfect sum gives us:

sumDiff=x−y
​
 
Similarly, if we compute the sum of squares from our grid (sqrSum) and compare it with perfectSqrSum, we get:

sqrDiff=x 
2
 −y 
2
 
​
 
Now, we recall a fundamental algebraic identity:

x 
2
 −y 
2
 =(x+y)⋅(x−y)
​
 
Since we already know x−y from sumDiff, we can substitute it into the equation:

sqrDiff=(x+y)⋅sumDiff
​
 
Rearranging this equation, we can solve for x+y:

x+y= 
sumDiff
sqrDiff
​
 
​
 
Now, we have two simple equations:

x−y=sumDiff
​
 
x+y= 
sumDiff
sqrDiff
​
 
​
 
Solving for x and y:

x= 
2
sqrDiff/sumDiff+sumDiff
​
 
​
 
y= 
2
sqrDiff/sumDiff−sumDiff
​
 
​
 
This mathematical derivation translates directly into our code. We first calculate the actual sums from our grid and then compute the perfect sums using the formulas. The differences between these give us sumDiff and squareDifference, which we can plug into our final formulas to get the repeating and missing numbers.

Note: One important implementation detail is the use of long instead of int for our calculations. This is crucial because when we're dealing with squares of numbers, we can easily exceed the integer range.

Algorithm
Initialize variables:
sum and sqrSum to 0 to store the actual sums from the grid.
n to store the length of the grid.
Initialize a variable total to n * n to store the total number of elements.
For each row in the grid:
For each col in the grid:
Add the current element to sum.
Add the square of the current element to sqrSum.
Calculate the sumDiff by subtracting the expected sum (total * (total + 1) / 2) from the actual sum.
Calculate the sqrDiff by subtracting the expected square sum (total * (total + 1) * (2 * total + 1) / 6) from the actual sqrSum.
Calculate repeat using the formula (sqrDiff / sumDiff + sumDiff) / 2.
Calculate missing using the formula (sqrDiff / sumDiff - sumDiff) / 2.
Return an array containing repeat and missing numbers.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the side length of the grid.

Time complexity: O(n 
2
 )

The algorithm iterates through each cell in the n×n grid exactly once using two nested loops. All other operations (calculating sums, differences, and the final values) are constant time operations. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n 
2
 ).

Space complexity: O(1)

The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables (sum, sqrSum, n, total, sumDiff, sqrDiff) regardless of the input size. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
