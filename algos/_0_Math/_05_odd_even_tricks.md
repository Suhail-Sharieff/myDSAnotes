## Sum of Consecutive Numbers

This project contains formulas for calculating the sums of the first \( n \) consecutive odd and even numbers.

### Sum of Odd Numbers

The sum of the first `n` odd numbers is:

**S_odd = n^2**

#### Example:
- For n = 1: S_odd = 1^2 = 1
- For n = 3: S_odd = 3^2 = 9 (1 + 3 + 5 = 9)

---

### Sum of Even Numbers

The sum of the first `n` even numbers is:

**S_even = n(n + 1)**

#### Example:
- For n = 1: S_even = 1(1 + 1) = 2
- For n = 3: S_even = 3(3 + 1) = 12 (2 + 4 + 6 = 12)
