# Work 
- A can do total work in `x` days and B can `y` days then rate of A =`1/x` and rate of B=`1/y`, if they work together then total rate of work is `1/x + 1/y` work per day, ie they finish total work in `1/(1/x+1/y)` days
- A can do in `x` days and `B` can in `y` days, then find how mnay days it would take if A does for `m` days and B does for `n` days. Solution: just form 2 equations and solve
# Speed, Time, Distance
- These are mostly easy
