# Work 
- A can do total work in `x` days and B can `y` days then rate of A =`1/x` and rate of B=`1/y`, if they work together then total rate of work is `1/x + 1/y` work per day, ie they finish total work in `1/(1/x+1/y)` days
- A can do in `x` days and `B` can in `y` days, then find how mnay days it would take if A does for `m` days and B does for `n` days. Solution: just form 2 equations and solve
# Speed, Time, Distance
- These are mostly easy
- Uses relative velocicty, train platform problems etc
# Boat and river
- upstream net velocity = v(boat)+v(river)
- down stream net velocity = v(boat)-v(river)
- Man goes and comes back, means while going take upstreama nd while returning take downstream
- Man goes `x1`km upstream and `y1`km in `t1` hrs and `x2`km upstream and `y2` km downstream in `t2` hrs, then `x1/u+v  +  x2/u-v = t1` and similarly form for other case also, take `u+v` as p and `u-v` as q, solve both equations to get value of p and q , finally find p and q
# Ratio and proportions
- `a:b` and `b:c` is given, say `a:b`=`3:5` and `c:d`=`7:8` , ASKED `a:b:c`, to make it so in both eqns make some how b equal, in this case we can so by `a:b`=`21:35` and `b:c`=`35:8`, then `a:b:c`=`21:35:8`
- If `girls:boys` ratio given as `g:b`, and say `t` students in total, then `gx+bx=t` holds good
- If alloy `A` consists of `gold:silver` in `7:2`, whereas `B` has in `7:11`, when `C` is formed by melting A and B in equal ration, fing `g:c` in C. Imagine like `1g of A has 7/9 g gold and 2/9 g copper`, similar for B, then when mixed , ie `2g C has (7/9 + 7/18)g gold and (2/9 + 11/18)g Copper`
# Ages 
- These are also generally easy
# Areas
- `ar(traingle)=sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))` where `s=(a+b+c)>>1`
- Side of equilateral traingle inscribing a circle is `2root(3)r`, whereas the one excribing a circle is `root(3)r`
-  `ar(llgm)=b*h` also `(d1*d2)>>1`, same for rhombus
- `ar(trapezium)=h(a+b)>>1`
- `ar(sector)=(pi*pow(r,2)*thetha)/360`
- `length(segment)`=`2*pi*r*theta/180`
# Combinatorics
- `Permuatation`: ways to select and dearrange as well, `Combination`:ways to select only. ex: for string "abc" `3C2={ab,bc,ca}` whereas `3P2={ab,ba,bc,cb,ca,ac}`
- So `nPr=nCr*(r!)`
- Also `nCr=nC(n-r)`, for ex `100 C 98` = `100 C 2`, where RHS is much easier to calc
- No of ways to form new word using letters in `ENGINEERING`, `ans=(11!)/(3!*3!*2!*2!)` ie dont forget to divide by no of repetitions too
- `and` case `multiply`, `or`case `add`, when `atleast` given cosnider further cases too
# Simple Interest and Compound  Interest
- in case of simple interest the rate on initial money remains fixed, for ex 8k borrowed at 10% interest would mean that every year 10% of 8k needs to be paid irrespective of the current status of balance, in compund interest the money rate is with respect to current balance and not just the initial one.
- `SI=ptr/100` where t is always in years, so be careful since in majority cases time is given in days or months, p is the principal amt ie initial amt, r is rate
- `CI=P (1+(R1/100))^t1 * (1+(R2/100))^t2.....`
- Suppose say rate given for half yearly for 2 years then eqn transforms as `P(1+(R/200))^(2*2)`,observe both dr and power changes
- Now suppose given for 3 yr 3 months, eqn transforms as `P((1+(R/100))^3 * (1+(3R/1200))^1)`,  observe the split


# Clocks
- Minute hand covers `6 deg` per minute
- Hour hand covers `30 deg` per hr ie `1/2 deg` per min
- `MCQ: `min hand gains `55` minutes over hour hand
- Hour and minute hand coincides `once` per hour
- One tricy part is, question: `how many times will hr and min hand conincide say between 2 am and 2pm `, answer is NOT 12, its 11(think about case at 12 am), so the thing is `if x<12, then hr and min hand coincides x times in x hr interval`, if more then `x-(x/12) times`, same formula for number of times the hr and minute hand are in straight line or 180deg to each other
- Similary, for evrry 1 hr minute and hr hand becomes perpendicular `twice`, in `12 hrs 22 times`,`24 hrs 44 times`
- The mirror time can just be calculating by subtracting with 12, for ex the mirror timing for `5:17` is `6:43`
